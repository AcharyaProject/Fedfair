data.py
=======
Data loading for the federated fairness recertification experiments.

Two sources are supported:

1. REAL DATA (recommended for the paper): Folktables / ACS PUMS.
   Folktables provides real US Census microdata, naturally indexed by
   STATE and YEAR -- exactly the two axes of real, non-synthetic
   population drift we want (geographic drift across states, temporal
   drift across years). This requires internet access to census.gov,
   which is NOT available in this sandboxed environment, so the loader
   below will attempt it and gracefully fall back if it fails.

   To run with real data on your own machine:
       pip install folktables
       python run_experiment.py --data real

2. SYNTHETIC FALLBACK (used automatically here): a generator that
   mimics the structure of the ACS Income task (age, education,
   occupation code, hours worked, protected attribute = sex or race,
   label = income > $50k) with an explicit, controllable drift
   parameter so the whole pipeline is reproducible without internet
   access. This is what actually runs in this sandbox; swap in (1)
   for the real experiments in the paper.

    Generates one client's data (age, education, hours, occ_code, A, Y).

    structure in tasks like ACS Income, where hours-worked/occupation
    correlate with sex/race even though the model never sees A directly).

    The label is generated by a fixed ground-truth rule that does not
